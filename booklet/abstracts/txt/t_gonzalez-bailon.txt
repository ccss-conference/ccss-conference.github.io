The diffusion of information requires prior exposure: we cannot disseminate what we do not see. In online platforms, information exposure results from a complex interaction between social and algorithmic forms of curation that shapes what users see in their feeds. In this talk, I will discuss observational and experimental research using social media data that investigates (1) the role algorithms play in determining the information we encounter and (2) the impact, if any, of that exposure on users attitudes and behaviors.
