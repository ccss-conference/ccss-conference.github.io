This study investigates the phenomenon that Chinese fans repost fans contents of a Thai drama from Twitter to a Chinese social media. Through qualitative analysis of Red posts featuring Twitter screenshots, the study seeks to identify the contents that are carried from outside to inside of China via fan-mediated exchanges. Patterns of contents shared are examined to highlight the impact of fandom on culture contagion. Once the fan brokerage pathway is established, it is hypothesized that content beyond the drama itself, such as LGBTQ knowledge, can also be transmitted. The findings of this study could inform future research on information brokerage in the context of pop culture and transnational social media.
