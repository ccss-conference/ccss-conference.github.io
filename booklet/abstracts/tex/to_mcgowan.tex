    There is a complex interplay among factors in our daily lives that reflect our wellness. Whereas a poor night's sleep can put us in a bad mood making it difficult to accomplish our goals the next day, a brief burst of movement can put us in a good mood and help us feel accomplished almost immediately. Network science and complex system approaches offer tools that can address gaps in public health research. In this talk, I will show data from a naturalistic study showing how sleep, physical activity, mood, and purpose in life are connected and influence daily wellness from one day to the next. I will then describe ways forward for network science and complex systems approaches to move forward public health.
