        The COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. In this talk, we use mathematical models to investigate the potential future SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, landscapes of immunity, and the effect of vaccination. Since there is substantial uncertainty on the strength and duration of immunity following natural infection or vaccination, we examine a range of scenarios. I will also briefly highlight model extensions that address dosing regimes, vaccine nationalism, and the potential medium-term accumulation of immunity and chronic disease. Overall, I will provide a broad overview, and illustrate the power of mathematical modelling to titrate the impact of immune uncertainties.
